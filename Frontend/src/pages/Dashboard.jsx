                                Our cake, delightful miniature treats, have long been a staple of celebrations and casual gatherings alike. With diminutive size and endless variety, cupcakes originated in the United States in the 19th century. The term "cupcake" was first mentioned in E. Leslie's "Receipts" cookbook in 1828. Traditionally, cupcakes were made using a standard measure of ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs.

                                A croissant is a buttery, flaky pastry of Austrian origin, but largely associated with France. Crescent-shaped and made from layered yeast-leavened dough, croissants are created by laminating the dough with butter, then rolling and folding several times in succession. The result is a layered, flaky texture similar to that of puff pastry. Croissants are a staple of French bakeries and breakfast tables worldwide.

                                A cookie is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat, and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, and some type of oil or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, or nuts. In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crisp cookies are called biscuits. Many cookies are baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft.
